			<h2>Research</h2>

			<p>My goal is to understand and improve the algorithms that researchers can use to learn about the structure of an underlying system from data and reason about intervening in such a system. </p>

					<p><b>Structure learning and hypothesis testing -- </b> What we assume about the underlying causal structure affects how we understand data and the association between variables. I am interested in learning from data alone the invariant features of the underlying causal graph, with a particular interest in problems involve complex data types. In recent work, we showed how to <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SsHBkfeRF9L">learn local independence graphs</a> from irregularly-sampled time series data.
					</p>
					<p>
					<b>Causal inference -- </b> With knowledge of the causal graph, quantifying the effect of an intervention or counterfactual can be equally challenging. I am also motivated by treatment effect estimation problems and questions of transportability asking under what conditions a particular effect can be computed in a target population. Representative work in this direction include algorithms for individualized treatment effect estimation with <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v108/zhang20c/zhang20c.pdf">discrete</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14692.pdf">continuous</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.08311.pdf">longitudinal</a> treatments, and bounding counterfactuals in target domains.
					</p>
					<p>
					<b>Application of machine learning in health -- </b> A move towards data-driven decision making in healthcare has the potential to revolutionize patient care. I am interested in general machine learning applications in healthcare, especially those that incorporate causality into their reasoning. Together with colleagues we have worked on several survival prediction algorithms in this area.
