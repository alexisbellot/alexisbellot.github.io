			<h2>Research</h2>

			<p> My research spans algorithms, theory, and applications of machine learning and causal inference. </p>

			<p>	I am interested in the development of AI systems that can guarantee valid and robust predictions in the context of heterogeneous data from multiple different environments. </p>

			<p> There is a subtle interplay between the data we observe and the underlying system we ultimately seek to model. The study of causality from data formalizes this connection, allowing us to reason about the effect of interventions and about counterfactuals. My goal is to develop this research agenda to improve decision-making with data in applications, such as healthcare, and to guarantee the safety and alignment of AI algorithms.
